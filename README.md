# Welcome!

This is a small, brief project to help some fellow student devs to start to transition from their knowledge of basic HTML/CSS and Vanilla JS into getting started with ReactJS. It is intended to be used alongside other learning resources, and was tailored to suit the skill levels of a specific group of people.

# Level 1: Html Only

Open up L1-HTML-Only/index.html and take a look.

# Level 2: HTML and basic JS

Open up L2-HTML-and-JS/index.html and and script.js. Take a look.

# Level 3: Using JS more dynamically

Open up L3-L4-Using-JS-Dynamically/index.html and script.js, and take a look.

# Level 4: Moving toward ReactJS methodology while staying

Open up L3-L4-Using-JS-Dynamically/index.html and script.js, and take a look.

# Level 5: Using ReactJS: Working with React Functional Components and JSX Elements.

- If you haven't already, install nodejs and npm pacakage manager.
- Navigate to the l5-react folder in the VS Code terminal.
- Type in 'npm install' and hit enter. This to install all required packages and modules so that reactjs runs.
- Once finished, type in 'npm start' and wait for it to open in your browser.
- Have a look at l5-react/src/App.js to see the starting point for the react app.
- In order, look at: App.js, components/header.js, components/nav.js, components/mainContent.js

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
